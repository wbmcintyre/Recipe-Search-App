# Recipe-Search-App

The goal of this project was to use MVC in javascript to pull info from a recipe API, display it with pagination, bookmark recipes through the use of local storage, and post their own recipes to the API.

### Functionality 

Users can use the search bar at the top to create a pull request from the API. The results will be displayed on the left. Selecting a recipe will display its description on the right side. The recipe can be bookmarked and saved to local storage for use later. All bookmarked recipes can be viewed at the top right. Lastly, a user can create their own recipe to add to API.
